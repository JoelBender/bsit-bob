## Classes

### Equipment (s223:Equipment)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Equipment)

`Equipment` is the modeling construct used to represent a thing designed to accomplish a specific task, or a complex thing
that contains component pieces of `Equipment` that are connected to each other and work together to accomplish a task. `Equipment` can have
`Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s through which one or more kinds of medium (see {s223:Substance-Medium}) might flow. Examples of possible `Equipment` include a `Pump`,
`Fan`, `AirHeatExchanger`, `Luminaire`, and `Sensor`, as well as more complex things like a heat pump, a chilled water plant, or a utility meter.
`Equipment` is distinct from a `System`, which is simply a logical grouping or collection of (only) `Equipment`.

In common usage, terms like equipment and system have a variety of ambiguous and possibly conflicting interpretations. A semantic model is
an attempt to eliminate such ambiguities and conflicts. If the thing being modeled involves `Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s, it must be modeled as
`Equipment` and not a `System`. Thus, a model of a chilled water plant that includes external connections to things beyond the plant must
be modeled as `Equipment`. Any contained `Equipment` within the chilled water plant (i.e., the pumps, valves, filters, and other things) may alternatively or in
addition be logically grouped and modeled as a `System`.

The graphical depiction of Equipment used in this document is a round-cornered
rectangle as shown in Figure 5-1.

### System (s223:System)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/System)

A logical grouping of one or more `Equipment` or other `System`s for some functional purpose.

### Physical Space (s223:PhysicalSpace)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/PhysicalSpace)

A `PhysicalSpace` is an architectural concept representing a room, a part of a room, a collection of rooms, or any other physical region in a building. PhysicalSpaces may be grouped to define larger `PhysicalSpace`s using the relation `contains` (see {s223:contains}).

### Domain Space (s223:DomainSpace)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/DomainSpace)

A `DomainSpace` represents some portion of a `PhysicalSpace` that is affected by a building service associated with a domain. `DomainSpace`s may represent an entire `PhysicalSpace` or any portion of a `PhysicalSpace` (see {s223:PhysicalSpace}). Multiple `DomainSpace`s of the same domain may overlap, and `DomainSpace`s of different domains may also overlap. `DomainSpace`s may be grouped into `Zone`s using the relation `hasDomainSpace` (see {s223:hasDomainSpace}).

### Zone (s223:Zone)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Zone)

A logical grouping of one or more `DomainSpace`s for a specific domain for some building service or control-related purpose. Zones may be grouped into ZoneGroups (see {s223:ZoneGroup}).

### Connectable (s223:Connectable)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Connectable)

`Connectable` is an abstract class representing a thing such as, `Equipment` (see {s223:Equipment}), `DomainSpace` (see {s223:DomainSpace}), or `Junction` (see {s223:Junction}) that can be `connected` via connection points and connections.

### Connection (s223:Connection)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Connection)

A `Connection` is the modeling construct used to represent the thing (e.g., pipe, duct, conductor, or free space) that is used to convey
some Medium (e.g., water, air, electricity, light, wi-fi) between two connectable things. All connections have two or more connection points bound
to either `Equipment` (see {s223:Equipment}), `DomainSpace` (see {s223:DomainSpace}), or `Junction` (see {s223:Junction}). See Figure 6-2. If the direction
of flow is constrained, that constraint is indicated by using one or more `InletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:InletConnectionPoint}) to represent the
inflow points and `OutletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:OutletConnectionPoint}) to represent the outflow points.

A `Connection` may contain branches or intersections. These may be modeled using `Junction`s if it is necessary to identify a specific intersection.
(see {s223:Junction}).

The constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Connection` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple
validation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents. See {s223:Substance-Medium} for
more details.

![Graphical Depiction of Connection.](figures/Figure_5-3_Connection.svg)

### Junction (s223:Junction)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Junction)

A `Junction` is a modeling construct used when a branching point within a `Connection` (see {s223:Connection}) is of significance,
such as specifying the observation location of a `Sensor`, or when a modeler wants to expose a branch point within a containing piece of `Equipment`.
When a `Junction` is used, what might have been modeled as a single, branched `Connection`
is separated into three or more separate connections, all tied together with the `Junction` and its associated connection points.

`Junction` is a subClassOf `Connectable`, which gives it the ability to have connection points, but unlike Equipment (and like Connection)
it is not allowed to change the Medium that passes through it. This is why `Junction` is a sibling class to `Equipment` and not a subclass.
This constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Junction` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple
validation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents. See {s223:Substance-Medium} for
more details.

### ConnectionPoint (s223:ConnectionPoint)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/ConnectionPoint)

A `ConnectionPoint` is an abstract modeling construct used to represent the fact that one connectable thing can be connected to another connectable thing using a `Connection`. It is the abstract representation of the flange, wire terminal, or other physical feature where a connection is made. `Equipment`, `DomainSpace`s and `Junction`s can have one or more `ConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:Connectable}).

A `ConnectionPoint` is constrained to relate to a specific medium such as air, water, or electricity which determines what other things can be connected to it. For example, constraining a ConnectionPoint to be for air means it cannot be used for an electrical connection.

A `ConnectionPoint` belongs to exactly one connectable thing (see {s223:Connectable}).

`ConnectionPoint`s are represented graphically in this standard by a triangle with the point indicating a direction of flow, or a diamond in the case of a bidirectional flow as shown in Figure 6-1.

[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/InletConnectionPoint)

An `InletConnectionPoint` is a `ConnectionPoint` for which a medium (`Substance-Medium`) is expected to flow into the associated `Connectable`.

### Outlet Connection Point (s223:OutletConnectionPoint)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/OutletConnectionPoint)

An `OutletConnectionPoint` is a `ConnectionPoint` for which a medium (`Substance-Medium`) is expected to flow out of the associated `Connectable`.

### Bidirectional Connection Point (s223:BidirectionalConnectionPoint)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/BidirectionalConnectionPoint)

A `BidirectionalConnectionPoint` is a `ConnectionPoint` for which a medium (`Substance-Medium`) is expected to flow either into or out of the associated `Connectable`.

### Property (s223:Property)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Property)

An attribute, quality, or characteristic of a feature of interest.

The `Property` class is the parent of all variations of a `Property`, which are:
`ActuatableProperty` - subclass of `Property` that can be modified by user or machine outside of the model (typically command);
`ObservableProperty` - subclass of `Property` that are observed (typically measures);
`EnumerableProperty` - subclass of `Property` defined by `EnumerationKind`;
`QuantifiableProperty` - subclass of `Property` defined by numerical values.

And their subclass combinations :
`QuantifiableActuatableProperty`,
`QuantifiableObservableProperty`,
`EnumeratedObservableProperty`,
`EnumeratedActuatableProperty`.

A `QuantifiableProperty` (or subClass thereof) shall always be associated with a `Unit` and a `QuantityKind`, either explicitly from the `Property`,
or through the associated Value. If the `Unit` is defined, the SHACL reasoner (if invoked) will figure out and assert a `QuantityKind` if it is
unambiguous.

Enumerable properties shall be associated with an `EnumerationKind`. Different flavors of properties are shown in Figure 11-1.

![Different flavors of Properties](figures/Figure_11-1_Flavors_of_Properties.svg)

A `Property` instance that is not an instance of one of the subclasses is unconstrained with respect to its value.

### Observable Property (s223:ObservableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/ObservableProperty)

The term "observable" implies that reading the `ObservableProperty` value will return the result of a physical observation, usually by a `Sensor`.
In contrast, the term "actuatable" (see {s223:ActuatableProperty}) implies that writing to the `ActuatableProperty` value will directly trigger a physical actuation.

### Actuatable Property (s223:ActuatableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/ActuatableProperty)

The term "actuatable" implies that writing to the `ActuatableProperty` value will directly trigger a physical actuation by either an `Actuator` or `Equipment`.
In contrast, the term "observable" (see {s223:ObservableProperty}) implies that reading the `ObservableProperty` value will return the result of a physical observation.

### Quantifiable Property (s223:QuantifiableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/QuantifiableProperty)

This class is for quantifiable values that describe an object (`System`, `Equipment`, etc.) that are typically static (`hasValue`). That is, they are neither measured nor specified in the course of operations.

### Quantifiable Observable Property (s223:QuantifiableObservableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/QuantifiableObservableProperty)

This class is for instances of `QuantifiableProperty` for which numerical values are observed, like a temperature reading or a voltage measure.

### Quantifiable Actuatable Property (s223:QuantifiableActuatableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/QuantifiableActuatableProperty)

This class is for instances of `QuantifiableProperty` for which numerical values are specified to be modifiable by a user or a machine outside of the model, like a setpoint.

### Enumerable Property (s223:EnumerableProperty)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/EnumerableProperty)

An `EnumerableProperty` is a `Property` with an enumerated (fixed) set of possible values.

### ExternalReference (s223:ExternalReference)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/ExternalReference)

`ExternalReference` is an abstract class that represents a thing that contains API or protocol parameter values necessary to associate a `Property` with a value.

### BACnetExternalReference (s223:BACnetExternalReference)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/BACnetExternalReference)

An `ExternalReference` that contains BACnet protocol parameter values necessary to associate a `Property` with a value.

### Function (s223:Function)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Function)

A `Function` is used to model transfer and/or transformation of information (i.e., `Property`). It has relations to input Properties and output Properties. The actual algorithms that perform the transformations are described in CDL and are out of scope of the 223 standard.

### Sensor (s223:Sensor)
[Open223 term](https://explore.open223.info/s223/Sensor)

A `Sensor` `observes` an `ObservableProperty` (see {s223:ObservableProperty})
which may be quantifiable (see {s223:QuantifiableObservableProperty}), such as a
temperature, flow, or concentration, or enumerable (see {s223:EnumeratedObservableProperty}),
such as an occupancy state.

If a `Sensor` observes a `QuantifiableObservableProperty` relative to an assumed
or common reference point, it can be modeled with only an observation location.
For example:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.com/> .

:example1 a s223:TemperatureSensor ;
    s223:hasObservationLocation :location1 ;
    qudt:hasQuantityKind qudtqk:Temperature .
```

If a `Sensor` observes a `QuantifiableObservableProperty` relative to a unique
or specified reference point, it can be modeled with an observation location and
a reference location, and indicating the difference between two values by setting `isDeltaQuantity` to `true`. For example:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.com/> .

:example2 a s223:TemperatureSensor ;
    s223:hasObservationLocation :location1 ;
    s223:hasReferenceLocation :location2 ;
    qudt:hasQuantityKind qudtqk:Temperature ;
    qudt:isDeltaQuantity true .
```
